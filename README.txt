Analysis software: MATLAB 2022a

Pre-processing was performed using functions adapted from: 
LeMessurier AM. 2019. https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/imaging_analysis_pipeline

Example Data:
Data are provided for two example sessions: 'ExampleSession1.mat' & 'ExampleSession2.mat'

Data for example sessions includes the following variables:
mouse_date_str: Session identifier (mouse id and date)
allcells: Cell array that lists all ROIs
deltaF: Structure containing dF/F traces for entire imaging movie segments
Stimuli: Go/NoGo stimulus onset times (in seconds, relative to segment onset) for each imaging movie segment
Licks: Lick onset times and matched no-lick times (in seconds, relative to segment onset) for each imaging movie segment (for each lick types)
peristimstruct: median dF/F traces aligned to Go (BW and CW) and NoGo (dummy piezo) times for each ROI
perilickstruct: median dF/F traces aligned to lick (ITI licks, FA licks, Hit licks, Unrewarded Hit licks) and matched no-lick times for each ROI
sig_inds_w: Logical vector specifying significantly whisker-reponsive ROIs (1 = whisker-responsive, 0 = no significant whisker-response)
sig_inds_l: Logical vector specifying significantly lick-reponsive ROIs (1 = lick-responsive, 0 = no significant lick-response)
BWid: Numerical best whisker for each ROI
CWid: Columnar whisker for each ROI
CWidnearest: Columnar whisker for each ROI, with nearest column listed for septal cells
whisk: whisker identities tested on Go Trials, corresponding to piezos 0-8
lickmetrics: structure containing dF/F magnitudes computed for pre-lick and post-lick (early and late) windows aligned to lick times and matched no lick times
ranktcstruct: structure containing rank-ordered whisker-evoked responses and nogo responses for generating tuning curves 
plotparams_whiskers: plotting parameters for summary plot of whisker responses
plotparams_lick: plotting parameters for summary plot of lick responses

Plotting functions provided:
PlotWhiskerEvokedResponse
PlotMeanTuningCurve
PlotMeanLickEvokedResponse
PlotLickMetrics

Supporting functions from MathWorks File Exchange:
shadedErrorBar (R. Campbell, 2009)
nansem (J. Gl√§scher, 2004)
pvpmod (U. Egert, modified by H. Hentschke 2017)

A script ('RunVIPExampleCode2023.m') is provided, which makes use of these plotting functions to generate summary plots for example data.
